# Formatted Input/Output

`scanf` and `printf` are two of the most used functions in `C`. They are both powerful and tricky to use.

## The `printf` function:

This function is designed to display the contents of a string (known as a _format string_).

The values to display could be constants, variables or more complicated expressions. 

The _format string_ can contain both ordinary characters and conversion specifications (that begin with the `%` character), these conversion specifications are placeholders representing a value to be filled during printing.
